# Time-Difference of Arrival (TDOA)

Position in plane from time of circular wavefront's arrival at each of three
detectors.

In the plane, a triangle of detectors, each of which records the time of the
arrival of a circular wavefront expanding at constant velocity from a point,
can be used to locate the point.
